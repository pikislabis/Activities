* 2009-apr-22 - update to support rails 2.3

  - Rails 2.3 changed the internal session code substantially. This new
    version now supports rails 2.3. Note that is no longer supports any
    version of rails prior to 2.3 -- see the README for where to find
    an older version of this plugin for rails 2.2 and earlier. 
  - CONFIGURATION OPTIONS HAVE CHANGED. This is required by the new
    support for rails 2.3. See the README for more information.

* 2008-jul-23 - update to improve rails 2.1 compatibility 
  
  - disable partial-updates for the session table
    (thanks to eilonon erkki for bringing the problem to my attention)
  
* 2007-sep-06 - initial release
