A plugin to modify the standard database-backed sessions behavior to be more
intelligent. 


Notes on Rails versions:
  Please note that as of this release, Rails 2.3+ is required. For use with
  Rails <= 2.2.x, see instead: 
  http://svn.iprog.com/projects/rails/plugins/limited_sessions-2.2

Upgrading from a pre-Rails 2.3 version:
  The configuration options have changed. If you've been using the defaults
  then no action is required. If you've been setting values, then you must
  make changes. See the Configuration section below on the new names for the
  settings.


Features:
  * Configurable session expiry time (eg: 2 hours from last page access)
  * Optional hard limit regardless of last page access (eg: 24 hours)
  * Optional ability to tie session to an IP or /24 subnet
  * Optional auto-cleaning of expired sessions
  
Requirements:
  * Rails 2.3+
  * A functional Rails app that uses the standard ActiveRecord::SessionStore
    session store (ActionController::Base.session_store = :active_record_store)
  * Ensure your sessions table has an `updated_at` column
  * If using hard session limits, a `created_at` column is needed too
  
Limitations:
  * IP restrictions are not IPv6 enabled for subnets (although it should work
    for a full match)
  * IP restrictions may or may not be sufficient or even work if a proxy is
    involved on the client side

Installation:
  Simply add this plugin into your rails app and configure if required.
  
  To add to your rails app:
    ./script/plugin install http://svn.iprog.com/projects/rails/plugins/limited_sessions
  
Configuration:
  There are several options that can be configured.  They should be placed at
  the end of config/environment.rb (or the individual <environment>.rb files
  if that's preferred).
  
  ActiveRecord::SessionStore::Session.recent_activity_limit = 2.hours
    This will expire sessions after the given period of time.  This is managed
    on the server side and if the user closes their browser, the session will
    also be gone.  Default is 2 hours.
  
  ActiveRecord::SessionStore::Session.hard_session_limit = 24.hours
    Sessions can also be forcefully expired without regard to the last
    activity.  So if this is set to 24 hours and the above is two hours, the 
    session will be terminated if a) the user has been inactive for more than
    two hours OR b) it has been more than 24 hours since the session began.
    Default is disabled (nil).  Requires a `created_at` column in the session
    table.
  
  ActiveRecord::SessionStore::Session.auto_clean_sessions = 1000
    Does a random test to see if the app should delete all expired sessions
    now.  The odds are 1 in whatever value is provided here.  0 will disable
    this option.  Default is 1000.  A busy site may want 10000 or higher.
    
  ActionController::Request.ip_restriction = :subnet
    If set to :subnet, will compare the first three quads of the IPv4 address
    for a match.  If set to :exact, will compare the full IP address (which
    should also work for IPv6).  If no match, the session will be reset.
    Default is :none.  Stores the IP match data in the session store as 
    session[:ip].


Other Notes:
  This is not compatible with an old `sessid` column; it only works with 
  `session_id`.

  I'm sure there are better ways to do some of what's here, but this seems to
  work.  It has been tested with Rails 2.3.2; PostgreSQL 8.1 and 8.3 and MySQL
  5.0. If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or just want to tell me that it
  works, I'd love to hear from you.  Thanks for checking limited_sessions out!
